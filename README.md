## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I'm Kevin, a Software Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano, one of Europe's top-ranked universities.
I graduated from Politecnico di Milano with a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering and the maximum grade of 110/110 with honours.
I am currently pursuing a MSc in Computer Science and Engineering.

ðŸ§ª Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged in extracurricular activities. I have had the opportunity to tutor several high school students in math, physics and computer science, providing guidance and fostering a passion for these subjects. This made me discover the beauty of helping others overcome challenges and discover their potential.

ðŸ¤– In order to gain further practical skills and following my interests, I have completed certifications in Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification, as well as Advanced Learning Algorithms provided by Stanford University and DeepLearning.AI. These certifications have enhanced my expertise in applying machine learning techniques and have broadened my understanding of cutting-edge algorithms.
